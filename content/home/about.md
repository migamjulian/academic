# About me

> I am a PhD student at the Friedrich-Schiller University of Jena, Germany hosted at the department of GIScience, Institute of Geography funded by the Indonesia-German Scholarship Program (IGSP) DAAD-DIKTI. I am doing my PhD research about the modelling of the hydrological processes to investigate the coupling effects of changing land use and climate on hydrogical dynamics.
